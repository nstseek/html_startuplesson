the setdefaults.sh file is for configurating PUC's computers without effort,
it's an automatic script that will install the applications, the configurations,
the commands and the shortcuts, works only with the packed applications that
already are on the DriveH and all the other files on DriveH/autoscript that
are dedicated to the script.

The swift compiler on debian can work, but you will need to do a lot of shit
A FUCKING LOT, at the present day, 08/09/2018, I had to update all the libicu
shit to the 60.2-6 version, including libicu-dev, icu-devtools, libharf some
shit and libc6 to the latest version, remember that these versions that I
mentioned are unstable/testing versions, so, I had to change the /etc/apt/
sources.list and insert deb ftp://ftp.br.debian.org/debian testing main non-free
contrib and unstable and even experimental in certain cases, this piece of shit
was a pain in the ass, but I made it through, I'm just asking myself until what
day this will work, because the versions installed on my system aren't stable
and it wasn't meant to work with this packages, may God bless this systems.
